# news_ticker
display a series of number "0610172" using news_ticker<br />
"Persistence of vision" is used because by dault the 8 numbers should be the same in the same time.<br />
However, if we use high frequency to display the news ticker, it would be too fast for us to recognize if all the numbers are displayed at the same time.
